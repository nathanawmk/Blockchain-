# Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), Blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cybersecurity
Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), Blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI): A Proposed Comprehensive End to End Cybersecurity Solution to secure Critical Information Infrastructure (CII).

Highl-level Flow/Solution
1. IoT Devices writes its data/readings to blockchain/DLTs
2. Smart Contracts on DLTs calls out to AI models such as TensorFlow via Oraclize, a data carrier for decentralized applications 
3. Data/Readings are then further processed (i.e., state is updated) based on returned values from AI models
4. The use of smart contracts and IoT ensure data from device to blockchain cannot be tampered with -- AI will detect and predict anomaly. 

Assumptions:
1. A private blockchain is used for scalability purposes
2. Devices cannot be physically tampered
